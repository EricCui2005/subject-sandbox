1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
- Welcome back to US
Government and Politics.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,350
In previous lessons, we've looked at PACs,

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,523
specifically political action committees.

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,340
These are groups of
people that come together

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,940
in order to fund campaigns

6
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,253
to propagate issues that
they think are important.

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,270
Today we're gonna look at interest groups.

8
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,160
They're a little bit different,

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,565
but they're also consequential.

10
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:19,200
(chill music)

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,000
Interest groups are technically
organizations of people,

12
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,750
so groups of people that come together,

13
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,273
who share similar causes or concerns.

14
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,080
So they've got issues
that they wanna advance.

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,423
These can be broad,

16
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,053
as in very wide,

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,453
or very narrow,

18
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,410
a specific thing that
they think is important

19
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,760
and they wanna get it
passed by the government.

20
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,520
They try to influence the government

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,720
in order to address
those specific problems.

22
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,343
They influence via
something called lobbying.

23
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,210
This is when they try to put
pressure on the government,

24
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,550
that Senator or House of
Representative member,

25
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,020
and it could be positive
pressure or negative pressure,

26
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,730
such as we're gonna primary you.

27
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:02,563
If you don't do this

28
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,800
we're gonna have somebody else
run and try to replace you.

29
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,900
Or if you do this, we can
contribute to your campaign

30
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,450
and make sure that you remain popular

31
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,673
with your constituents.

32
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,663
Third, this is protected
via the First Amendment,

33
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,453
specifically, the ability to assemble.

34
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,380
So the same way that you
can come together in a march

35
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,733
you can come together
in an interest group.

36
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,490
So let's talk about some of

37
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,540
these different types of interest groups.

38
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,680
It could be something from labor unions,

39
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,890
and these would address
conditions of working people,

40
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,123
such as safety, hours, and compensation.

41
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,583
Some of the bigger ones are AFL-CIO.

42
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,360
They were separate labor unions,

43
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,433
but they actually merged in 1955.

44
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,600
We can also look at business organizations

45
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,300
and these interest
groups are gonna promote

46
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,123
the collective interest of business,

47
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,210
and they're generally
gonna oppose regulation

48
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,593
and legislation that
promotes workers' rights,

49
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,220
'cause they really try to
represent the business community.

50
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,220
This is such as the US
Chamber of Congress,

51
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,263
which actually has 3 million members.

52
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,333
They promote a wide variety of issues.

53
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,233
Also the National
Association of Manufacturers.

54
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,270
Then we can have
professional organizations,

55
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,560
and they're gonna address anything

56
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,100
that that group of people wants,

57
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,743
such as the American Bar
Association for lawyers,

58
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,253
or the American Medical
Association, AMA, for doctors.

59
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,453
Then we have agricultural organizations.

60
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,543
These address farms and large
scale agricultural issues,

61
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,913
such as the American
Farm Bureau Federation.

62
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,140
Environmental groups,
such as the Sierra Club,

63
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,490
Greenpeace, or Environmental Defense Fund

64
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,900
are gonna advance
environmental protections

65
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,700
in order to protect the planet
and fight climate change.

66
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,170
Then you've got single issue groups.

67
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,710
These are like single issue voters,

68
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,350
but they're groups of those voters.

69
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,550
They think that one specific concern

70
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,420
really overrides everything else.

71
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,130
You can look at this with NOW,

72
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,283
the National Association
of Women, or the NAACP.

73
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,173
Finally we've got
government interest groups.

74
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,470
These are groups of representatives

75
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,090
or state and local officials

76
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,960
who will come together in
some type of an organization

77
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,930
in order to push forward policies

78
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,980
and issues that they think are important.

79
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,223
You can look at this with

80
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:11,013
the National Governor's Association.

81
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,820
So obviously there's
many, many, many different

82
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,653
interest groups,

83
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,260
but not all are gonna be equal

84
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,773
in terms of their size or influence.

85
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,130
For example, some interest
groups have access

86
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,523
to more money than others.

87
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,520
Via this money they can fund projects,

88
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,743
they can advertise,

89
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,410
and really try to influence legislation

90
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,133
in their favor in a greater way.

91
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,840
Some interest groups have
more access to politicians

92
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,293
and other decision makers.

93
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,170
So when they pick up the phone,

94
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,263
that representative answers that call.

95
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,180
Some interest groups have even
more dedicated participants

96
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,380
that they can rely upon.

97
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,260
These can be people that are actually

98
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,940
paid for their time and effort,

99
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,390
or people that are just
so dedicated to the issue

100
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,440
that they really wanna be there
whenever that's necessary.

101
00:03:56,385 --> 00:03:57,635
I'll give you an example.

102
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,883
The NRA is the National Rifle Association.

103
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,780
They have a lot of money.

104
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,260
They have direct access to politicians

105
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,080
that really want their endorsement

106
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,710
when it's time for an election,

107
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,660
and they've got a lot of members

108
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,770
that believe fervently
in the Second Amendment

109
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,370
and wanna do what the NRA says

110
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,220
in order to advance that legislation.

111
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,470
There's also something called movements.

112
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,250
They're not exactly issue groups

113
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,080
'cause they're not as organized

114
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,230
or as identifiable as
a group like the NRA,

115
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,870
but you can take a look at the
Black Lives Matter movement,

116
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,220
or the Me Too movement
to see a bunch of people

117
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,330
coming together and fighting for a concern

118
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,230
and an issue that's important to them.

119
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,560
These movements can be
very impactful as well,

120
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,140
as we saw in the summer of 2020

121
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,860
after to the murder of George Floyd.

122
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,910
So today we've looked at interest groups,

123
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,070
how they differ from
political action committees,

124
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,070
but how they're also very consequential.

125
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,830
We looked at the different types

126
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,870
and how they can be
different among themselves

127
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,970
in terms of the effect that they can have.

128
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,820
If you have an issue
that's important to you

129
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,650
I would suggest that you
find an interest group

130
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,760
and really see how you can be

131
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,460
an active member of our democracy.
