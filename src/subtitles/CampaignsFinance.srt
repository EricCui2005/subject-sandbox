1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,210
- Welcome back to "US
Government and Politics".

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,363
In a previous lesson,

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,120
we looked at how a person
can become a normal citizen

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,220
and eventually ascend to the presidency.

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,913
However, in-between those
steps there's campaigning.

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,800
And campaigning is expensive.

7
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,603
You need to travel around, hold rallies,

8
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,193
send out mailers.

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,590
A lot of different things that
take cash in order to do it.

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,450
So where do they get this money?

11
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,683
And what's legal and
what's not acceptable?

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,670
We can look at Buckley v. Valeo

13
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,840
in 1976, the Supreme Court case,

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,800
to get a sense of where
the judicial branch

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,750
thinks the line is.

16
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,240
The issue was that FECA's
limit on campaign spending

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,853
violated the 1st Amendment
right to free speech.

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,460
Now what the heck is FECA?

19
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,043
That's the Federal Election
Campaign Act of 1971.

20
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,280
And that said there's a limit on spending.

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,680
You need to disclose who's
giving you the money.

22
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,740
And that the IRS is gonna step in

23
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,740
and be a little bit of a public advocate

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,770
and basically level the playing field

25
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,070
in terms of how much money

26
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,853
candidates can receive from
donors and then actually spend.

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,600
So this case was saying,
do those limitations

28
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,083
violate the 1st Amendment right to speech?

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,083
The Supreme court said, yes.

30
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,570
That by limiting campaign spending

31
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,663
Congress had violated
people's right to free speech,

32
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,670
because donating money to a candidate

33
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,543
was seen by the Supreme
court as free speech.

34
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,940
I'm exercising what I think is right

35
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,023
via the giving of that money.

36
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,520
The court also said

37
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,780
that spending money to influence elections

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,733
is a form of constitutionally
protected speech.

39
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,160
And that FECA's limitations
on that spending

40
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,310
was a violation of constitutional rights.

41
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,250
However, the controversy
around campaign finance

42
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,283
has not abated.

43
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,903
In 2002, we can see the
McCain Feingold Act,

44
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,653
also known as the Bipartisan
Campaign Reform Act or BCRA.

45
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,480
This did a number of things

46
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,170
in order to try to reign in spending

47
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,320
and make sure it's a little
bit more transparent.

48
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,720
You know where the money's
coming from and fair.

49
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,853
Number one, it banned
something called soft money.

50
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,743
This soft money is unregulated.

51
00:02:07,734 --> 00:02:09,800
There aren't limits on it,
there aren't laws on it.

52
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,100
You don't really know
what's going on exactly.

53
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,093
And the key thing about it,

54
00:02:13,093 --> 00:02:15,453
is it doesn't go to a specific candidate.

55
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,230
So it can be used to push
forward a certain policy

56
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,753
or a perspective, but
it's not to this person.

57
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,643
It also limited hard money.

58
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,280
This is money that is federally regulated

59
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,213
and it goes to a specific
candidate or campaign.

60
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,200
So I'm saying, "This is
my money, it's $2,000

61
00:02:35,277 --> 00:02:37,797
"and it's going to Mrs. X."

62
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,453
It also limited the
use of corporate money.

63
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,400
So it's money coming
directly from businesses

64
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,110
to fund ads that discuss political issues

65
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,343
within 60 days of a general election,

66
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,563
or 30 days of a primary.

67
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,980
Remember back to a previous lesson,

68
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,480
a primary is how a person
becomes the nominee

69
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,543
from a certain party.

70
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,470
They're putting a time limit on.

71
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,310
So you can't have six months of ads

72
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,513
that are funded by a corporation.

73
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,773
Finally, if you produced a negative ad,

74
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,760
something that was against
a specific candidate

75
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,763
or said something negative about them,

76
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,620
you would have to put your name on it.

77
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,473
You would say this ad
was produced by whoever.

78
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,533
They wanted that transparency.

79
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,503
They wanted a limit on the
amount of money that was spent,

80
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,313
the time in which those
ads could be produced.

81
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,670
And if it's negative,

82
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,160
you actually have to
put your name behind it,

83
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,010
so you can't hide behind a pseudonym.

84
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,160
One of the most critical
Supreme court cases

85
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,300
that we're gonna look
at in this entire course

86
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,893
deals with campaign finance.

87
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,400
It's specifically Citizens United

88
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,120
v. the Federal Election Commission.

89
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,653
And it happened in 2010.

90
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,480
Citizens United is a
nonprofit conservative group

91
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,030
and they wanted to advance a documentary

92
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,990
that they thought depicted
Hillary Clinton, accurately.

93
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,890
Other people would say depicted
her negatively or falsely.

94
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,970
So they said we should be able to spend

95
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,023
as much money as we want
pushing forth this documentary.

96
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,340
Federal Election Commission said

97
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,503
you can't do that by the BCRA.

98
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,680
Remember that McCain Feingold Act

99
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,420
that limited the amount of
money when ads could be run,

100
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,920
and if you have to add
your name to a negative ad.

101
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,943
This was challenged

102
00:04:12,943 --> 00:04:14,750
and went all the way up
to the Supreme court.

103
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,750
The main issue is, does the BCRA

104
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,393
violate the 1st Amendment
right to free speech?

105
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,450
The Citizens United have the right

106
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,380
to put forth that documentary and fund it

107
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,700
and say whatever they want.

108
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,223
Is that their constitutionally
protected right?

109
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,033
The Supreme court says, yes,

110
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,870
Citizens United, which is
technically a corporation

111
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,683
has the right to free speech,

112
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,253
the same as an individual.

113
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,610
The Supreme court base this upon

114
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,163
there's prior restraint on
political speech via the BCRA.

115
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,260
You may remember prior restraint

116
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,120
from when we talked about media

117
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,990
and what can be said
and what cannot be said.

118
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,970
Is basically saying, if
this is gonna harm somebody

119
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,633
you can't put out that story.

120
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,560
And the Supreme court is saying,

121
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,680
prior restraint cannot
be used in this case.

122
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,430
Citizens United can say what they want.

123
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,110
If they want to fund that documentary,

124
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,070
that's their business.

125
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,030
And if it ends up hurting Hillary Clinton

126
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,223
that does not outweigh Citizens
United right to free speech.

127
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
When would the ban have been acceptable?

128
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,150
If the corporate spending was
likely to lead to corruption.

129
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,670
To prevent corruption,

130
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,420
the organization may not
coordinate with the candidate.

131
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,320
So, if Citizens United was giving

132
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:26,740
$2 million in a duffle bag to candidate X,

133
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,490
then this may lead to candidate X

134
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,970
taking on policies that
would benefit Citizens United

135
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,373
in a quid pro quo, essentially corruption.

136
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,540
Therefore the Supreme court
would say, that's not allowed.

137
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,960
But because it's not a
direct handing of money

138
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,163
from Citizens United to a
candidate in that manner,

139
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,393
that this is allowed under free speech.

140
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,060
Citizens United has really changed the way

141
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,463
that campaign finance is done since 2010.

142
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,060
So let's recap what we talked about today.

143
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,203
In 1974, you have FECA.

144
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,510
This is the Federal Election
Commission Campaign Act.

145
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,650
This put limits on the amount of money

146
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,950
that an individual can
give to a candidate.

147
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,830
It also limited the total amount

148
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,470
that a candidate was allowed to spend,

149
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,590
and it required contributions
to be disclosed.

150
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,100
It's very important transparency

151
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,400
who's giving money to who.

152
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,330
Luckily the Valeo struck down the limits

153
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,130
on campaign spending by a candidate.

154
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,810
We're saying that's an important part

155
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,210
of the election process
the Supreme court ruled.

156
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,413
In 2002, we had the Bipartisan
Campaign Reform Act,

157
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,433
also known as the McCain Feingold Act.

158
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,253
This banned soft money,

159
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,690
limited the use of
corporate and union money,

160
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,273
and limited hard money.

161
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,620
We're really gonna
focus on this corporate.

162
