    2
    00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,690
    - Welcome back to US
    government and politics.
    
    3
    00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,210
    In previous lessons, we've
    looked at the important role
    
    4
    00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,110
    that the executive branch plays
    in the overall government.
    
    5
    00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,210
    Today we're gonna see how someone goes
    
    6
    00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,160
    from being a normal citizen to
    actually becoming president.
    
    7
    00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,450
    The first step in the process is someone
    
    8
    00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,203
    announcing their intention
    to run for president.
    
    9
    00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,130
    This literally is the
    first step in the process
    
    10
    00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,740
    and is all that needs to be done.
    
    11
    00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,930
    Often people stand in front
    of some grand building,
    
    12
    00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,713
    or the house that they grew up in,
    
    13
    00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,863
    or they come down a golden escalator.
    
    14
    00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,950
    But what's really important is they said,
    
    15
    00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,600
    I'm throwing my hat into the ring,
    
    16
    00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,023
    I am gonna put forth
    my name for president.
    
    17
    00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,730
    The next step in the process
    
    18
    00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,080
    is where elections actually
    start getting held.
    
    19
    00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,480
    This is where the various parties,
    
    20
    00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,980
    remember the Republicans and the Democrats
    
    21
    00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,910
    are the two main ones,
    are gonna figure out
    
    22
    00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,560
    who's gonna represent their party
    
    23
    00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:05,973
    in the race to be president.
    
    24
    00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,963
    Primaries, which happen in 80% of states,
    
    25
    00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,300
    can be closed, which means you have to be
    
    26
    00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,123
    an announced member of that
    party in order to vote,
    
    27
    00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,950
    or they can be open, which
    means anybody in the state,
    
    28
    00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,500
    whether you're Republican or Democrat,
    
    29
    00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,743
    can vote in that primary process.
    
    30
    00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,493
    20% of the states have
    something called caucuses.
    
    31
    00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,820
    It's a little bit of a
    different process where people
    
    32
    00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,870
    come together and they vote
    by holding their hands up,
    
    33
    00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,760
    and verbal processes,
    and things like that.
    
    34
    00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,370
    You don't need to know the ins and outs,
    
    35
    00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,683
    just know that it serves the main purpose,
    
    36
    00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,500
    which is that state's
    party is gonna decide
    
    37
    00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,563
    who they think should be
    the nominee from each party.
    
    38
    00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,303
    Next we go to nominating conventions.
    
    39
    00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,590
    This is where all the
    votes from the primaries
    
    40
    00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,770
    and/or caucuses are tallied
    up, and each party will say
    
    41
    00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,330
    this is the person that the
    Democrat party puts forward
    
    42
    00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,830
    as their presidential nominee,
    
    43
    00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,003
    or the Republicans put forth
    as their presidential nominee.
    
    44
    00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,950
    There's a lot of hoopla,
    balloons, people glad handing,
    
    45
    00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,930
    and kissing babies, and
    saying isn't this great,
    
    46
    00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,980
    we're gonna win, it's gonna be fantastic.
    
    47
    00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,720
    But a lot of it is getting set up
    
    48
    00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,003
    before the general election.
    
    49
    00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,650
    There's gonna be campaigning
    before the general election.
    
    50
    00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,543
    Basically from as soon as
    candidates officially announce,
    
    51
    00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,300
    they're gonna start campaigning,
    
    52
    00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,570
    which is they're gonna start
    running advertisements,
    
    53
    00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,453
    getting out and seeing people.
    
    54
    00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,900
    If you've ever seen the weird scenes
    
    55
    00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,710
    when people go to Iowa and the state fair
    
    56
    00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,060
    and they all eat a hot dog,
    
    57
    00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,363
    that's because they're running for office.
    
    58
    00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,690
    They're hoping that people see them
    
    59
    00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,560
    and say that person is a good
    leader, that person knows me,
    
    60
    00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,570
    and knows what I care
    about, and therefore,
    
    61
    00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,183
    they would be a good person
    to represent me as president.
    
    62
    00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,140
    The general election,
    which is the first Tuesday
    
    63
    00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,680
    of November of every four
    years, so it was in 2020,
    
    64
    00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,743
    now it's gonna be in 2024,
    then 2028, and so on,
    
    65
    00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,250
    is where the president
    is actually decided.
    
    66
    00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,030
    People go to the polls and they vote
    
    67
    00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,980
    for who they think should be president.
    
    68
    00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,340
    Then, each state will
    put forward the votes
    
    69
    00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,923
    that they have via the electoral college,
    
    70
    00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,410
    and those are all counted up,
    and the person with over 270
    
    71
    00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,060
    votes in the electoral
    college becomes the president.
    
    72
    00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,740
    That one's a little bit tricky.
    
    73
    00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,990
    It's not just the person
    with the most votes,
    
    74
    00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,403
    the popular vote winner,
    that becomes president.
    
    75
    00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,233
    The electoral college is key.
    
    76
    00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,940
    Let's look at that via a map.
    
    77
    00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,420
    So if you've never heard
    of the electoral college,
    
    78
    00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,760
    you'd say, shouldn't the
    person who has one more vote
    
    79
    00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,560
    than the other person become president?
    
    80
    00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,313
    That's what a popular vote is,
    
    81
    00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,840
    and some nations do have that,
    
    82
    00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,573
    but the United States has
    the electoral college.
    
    83
    00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,010
    And this was instituted as a
    compromise in the Constitution,
    
    84
    00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,530
    remember that, very important
    document we've talked about?
    
    85
    00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,770
    In order to make sure
    that the biggest states
    
    86
    00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,290
    don't have all the power, that
    some of the smaller states
    
    87
    00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,493
    also play a role in an election like this.
    
    88
    00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,510
    So, each state is gonna
    have an apportioned amount
    
    89
    00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,640
    of electoral votes based
    upon how many people
    
    90
    00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,070
    they have in the House of Representatives
    
    91
    00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,670
    and how many senators they have.
    
    92
    00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,930
    And remember, every
    state has two senators,
    
    93
    00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,160
    but the number of people that they have
    
    94
    00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,330
    in the House of Representatives
    
    95
    00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,330
    depends on the population of that state.
    
    96
    00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,690
    So California's gonna
    have 55 electoral votes
    
    97
    00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,823
    'cause they have 53 seats in the House.
    
    98
    00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,270
    Texas has 38 'cause they
    have 36 seats in the House.
    
    99
    00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,170
    Remember, 38 minus their two senators.
    
    100
    00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,470
    Some of the other big population states
    
    101
    00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,590
    that we want to be aware of;
    
    102
    00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:21,873
    Florida with 29, New York with 29.
    
    103
    00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,420
    These are ones that are really gonna dwarf
    
    104
    00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:28,700
    the smaller states, such as
    Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota,
    
    105
    00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,330
    they all have three, in terms
    
    106
    00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,390
    of their influence on
    the electoral college.
    
    107
    00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,853
    However, some of them
    are called swing states,
    
    108
    00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,440
    which is because they're
    a little bit more purple.
    
    109
    00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,853
    So rather than consistently
    red, like these states here,
    
    110
    00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,130
    they're typically gonna
    vote for Republicans
    
    111
    00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,830
    and red is used as the color
    to represent Republicans.
    
    112
    00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,730
    This is 2020, when the
    incumbent President Trump
    
    113
    00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,910
    was running against former
    Vice President Biden,
    
    114
    00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,450
    now President Biden, and blue states
    
    115
    00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,673
    are gonna be Democratic states.
    
    116
    00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,663
    Typically California is gonna go Democrat,
    
    117
    00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,973
    typically Washington and
    Oregon, typically the Northeast.
    
    118
    00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,673
    Not always, but generally
    those are gonna be blue states.
    
    119
    00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,040
    However, there are some swing states
    
    120
    00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,003
    that play a crucial role
    in the electoral college.
    
    121
    00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,623
    They're Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania,
    
    122
    00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,913
    and then it was Ohio and Florida,
    
    123
    00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,460
    but they've gone a little
    bit more red recently.
    
    124
    00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,950
    So, Republicans have been winning them
    
    125
    00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,400
    the past couple of elections.
    
    126
    00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,363
    What we wanna know is,
    within these states,
    
    127
    00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,860
    the popular vote matters, obviously.
    
    128
    00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,383
    If you win Florida by one
    vote, you win that state.
    
    129
    00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,710
    But then Florida submits their 29 votes
    
    130
    00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,603
    to the electoral college,
    
    131
    00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,483
    and those all get added up for each state.
    
    132
    00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:51,623
    The person that reaches
    270 becomes the president.
    
    133
    00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:56,330
    In 2020, President Biden
    got 306 electoral votes,
    
    134
    00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,380
    you could count up all these blue states.
    
    135
    00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,990
    And then President Trump got 232,
    
    136
    00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,790
    you can count up all the red states.
    
    137
    00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,780
    The last thing I wanna mention for this
    
    138
    00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,660
    is there's two states that
    vote by congressional district.
    
    139
    00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,010
    So rather than just tallying
    up the votes in their state
    
    140
    00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,063
    and saying our electoral
    college goes to this candidate,
    
    141
    00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,910
    it could be different depending on
    
    142
    00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,260
    the district of the state,
    so let's look at it.
    
    143
    00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,803
    Nebraska has five congressional districts.
    
    144
    00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,310
    They're gonna say four, at least in 2020,
    
    145
    00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,800
    of those congressional districts
    
    146
    00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,200
    think President Trump
    should be president again.
    
    147
    00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,093
    One, Omaha, thinks that President
    Biden should be president.
    
    148
    00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,870
    Therefore, Nebraska submits
    four electoral votes
    
    149
    00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,400
    for President Trump and one
    for Vice President Biden
    
    150
    00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,800
    at that time, now president.
    
    151
    00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,430
    Maine is gonna do something similar.
    
    152
    00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,430
    They have four congressional districts,
    
    153
    00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,390
    and in that case, three of those districts
    
    154
    00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,753
    went for Biden and one went for Trump.
    
    155
    00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,060
    So again, it's important
    to know popular vote
    
    156
    00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,743
    for the states, then
    become electoral college,
    
    157
    00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,883
    you need 270 to become president.
    
    158
    00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,770
    The last thing we're gonna
    mention is the advantages
    
    159
    00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,190
    that an incumbent president has,
    
    160
    00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,450
    incumbent meaning that's
    the president at the time.
    
    161
    00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,700
    So in 2020, it would've
    been President Trump.
    
    162
    00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,740
    In 2024, if President
    Biden decides to run again,
    
    163
    00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,090
    it will be President Biden.
    
    164
    00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,250
    Some of these advantages are,
    
    165
    00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,720
    they already have name recognition.
    
    166
    00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,050
    If you listen to the
    news, you're gonna hear
    
    167
    00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,240
    President Biden, President
    Biden, President Biden a lot
    
    168
    00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,830
    because the policies that he makes,
    
    169
    00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,903
    or executive actions or laws
    that he signs into being,
    
    170
    00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,453
    or just whatever he's doing on that day,
    
    171
    00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,940
    the news is gonna report on.
    
    172
    00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,540
    So you hear that name a lot,
    
    173
    00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,140
    it's gonna resonate with people.
    
    174
    00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,793
    Number two, that's free publicity.
    
    175
    00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,290
    President Biden doesn't need to pay
    
    176
    00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,643
    those news companies to
    actually say his name,
    
    177
    00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,340
    they're already doing so in the course
    
    178
    00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,510
    of reporting on what's
    going on in the country.
    
    179
    00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,660
    So that free publicity
    is gonna be helpful.
    
    180
    00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,463
    And number three, something
    called franking privileges.
    
    181
    00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,150
    What this is is it allows lawmakers
    
    182
    00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,803
    to send materials to citizens.
    
    183
    00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,410
    The founders wanted this
    so that the lawmakers
    
    184
    00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,760
    could directly communicate
    with their citizens.
    
    185
    00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,343
    But as you send stuff to your citizens,
    
    186
    00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,093
    you can include things
    that make you look good.
    
    187
    00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,970
    If you saw the stimulus
    checks that went out,
    
    188
    00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,130
    they had President Trump's
    signature on the bottom.
    
    189
    00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,270
    This associates the money
    
    190
    00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,610
    that went into people's
    pockets with President Trump.
    
    191
    00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,400
    This is obviously beneficial to him,
    
    192
    00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,740
    and that's perfectly legal.
    
    193
    00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,390
    Because he's currently in
    office, he can send things
    
    194
    00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:20,313
    to the citizens, key
    thing, at taxpayer expense.
    
    195
    00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,850
    So he doesn't need to pay
    for it outta his own pocket,
    
    196
    00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,100
    the taxpayers pay for it.
    
    197
    00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,633
    These three things represent
    the incumbency advantages.
    
    198
    00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,853
    That's why, over the past 40 years or so,
    
    199
    00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,720
    there's only been two presidents,
    
    200
    00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,613
    the first President Bush
    and President Trump,
    
    201
    00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,133
    that have not won reelection
    and served two terms.
    
    202
    00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,740
    So today we've looked at the
    steps for a person to announce
    
    203
    00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,390
    their intention to run and
    actually become president.
    
    204
    00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,963
    We've looked at the electoral college,
    
    205
    00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,673
    specifically using 2020.
    
    206
    00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,510
    And we've looked at the
    advantages of an incumbent.
    
    207
    00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,950
    Hopefully it gives you a better sense
    
    208
    00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,600
    of how a person becomes president
    
    209
    00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,003
    and what role you play
    in that whole process.

    'Campaigns Finance and Controversies' : {id : "Ols7Ma8qKyotfU_XuRfsX", transcript : `1
    00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,210
    - Welcome back to "US
    Government and Politics".
    
    2
    00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,363
    In a previous lesson,
    
    3
    00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,120
    we looked at how a person
    can become a normal citizen
    
    4
    00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,220
    and eventually ascend to the presidency.
    
    5
    00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,913
    However, in-between those
    steps there's campaigning.
    
    6
    00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,800
    And campaigning is expensive.
    
    7
    00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,603
    You need to travel around, hold rallies,
    
    8
    00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,193
    send out mailers.
    
    9
    00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,590
    A lot of different things that
    take cash in order to do it.
    
    10
    00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,450
    So where do they get this money?
    
    11
    00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,683
    And what's legal and
    what's not acceptable?
    
    12
    00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,670
    We can look at Buckley v. Valeo
    
    13
    00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,840
    in 1976, the Supreme Court case,
    
    14
    00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,800
    to get a sense of where
    the judicial branch
    
    15
    00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,750
    thinks the line is.
    
    16
    00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,240
    The issue was that FECA's
    limit on campaign spending
    
    17
    00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,853
    violated the 1st Amendment
    right to free speech.
    
    18
    00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,460
    Now what the heck is FECA?
    
    19
    00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,043
    That's the Federal Election
    Campaign Act of 1971.
    
    20
    00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,280
    And that said there's a limit on spending.
    
    21
    00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,680
    You need to disclose who's
    giving you the money.
    
    22
    00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,740
    And that the IRS is gonna step in
    
    23
    00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,740
    and be a little bit of a public advocate
    
    24
    00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,770
    and basically level the playing field
    
    25
    00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,070
    in terms of how much money
    
    26
    00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,853
    candidates can receive from
    donors and then actually spend.
    
    27
    00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,600
    So this case was saying,
    do those limitations
    
    28
    00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,083
    violate the 1st Amendment right to speech?
    
    29
    00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,083
    The Supreme court said, yes.
    
    30
    00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,570
    That by limiting campaign spending
    
    31
    00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,663
    Congress had violated
    people's right to free speech,
    
    32
    00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,670
    because donating money to a candidate
    
    33
    00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,543
    was seen by the Supreme
    court as free speech.
    
    34
    00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,940
    I'm exercising what I think is right
    
    35
    00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,023
    via the giving of that money.
    
    36
    00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,520
    The court also said
    
    37
    00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,780
    that spending money to influence elections
    
    38
    00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,733
    is a form of constitutionally
    protected speech.
    
    39
    00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,160
    And that FECA's limitations
    on that spending
    
    40
    00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,310
    was a violation of constitutional rights.
    
    41
    00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,250
    However, the controversy
    around campaign finance
    
    42
    00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,283
    has not abated.
    
    43
    00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,903
    In 2002, we can see the
    McCain Feingold Act,
    
    44
    00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,653
    also known as the Bipartisan
    Campaign Reform Act or BCRA.
    
    45
    00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,480
    This did a number of things
    
    46
    00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,170
    in order to try to reign in spending
    
    47
    00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,320
    and make sure it's a little
    bit more transparent.
    
    48
    00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,720
    You know where the money's
    coming from and fair.
    
    49
    00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,853
    Number one, it banned
    something called soft money.
    
    50
    00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,743
    This soft money is unregulated.
    
    51
    00:02:07,734 --> 00:02:09,800
    There aren't limits on it,
    there aren't laws on it.
    
    52
    00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,100
    You don't really know
    what's going on exactly.
    
    53
    00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,093
    And the key thing about it,
    
    54
    00:02:13,093 --> 00:02:15,453
    is it doesn't go to a specific candidate.
    
    55
    00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,230
    So it can be used to push
    forward a certain policy
    
    56
    00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,753
    or a perspective, but
    it's not to this person.
    
    57
    00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,643
    It also limited hard money.
    
    58
    00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,280
    This is money that is federally regulated
    
    59
    00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,213
    and it goes to a specific
    candidate or campaign.
    
    60
    00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,200
    So I'm saying, "This is
    my money, it's $2,000
    
    61
    00:02:35,277 --> 00:02:37,797
    "and it's going to Mrs. X."
    
    62
    00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,453
    It also limited the
    use of corporate money.
    
    63
    00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,400
    So it's money coming
    directly from businesses
    
    64
    00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,110
    to fund ads that discuss political issues
    
    65
    00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,343
    within 60 days of a general election,
    
    66
    00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,563
    or 30 days of a primary.
    
    67
    00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,980
    Remember back to a previous lesson,
    
    68
    00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,480
    a primary is how a person
    becomes the nominee
    
    69
    00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,543
    from a certain party.
    
    70
    00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,470
    They're putting a time limit on.
    
    71
    00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,310
    So you can't have six months of ads
    
    72
    00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,513
    that are funded by a corporation.
    
    73
    00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,773
    Finally, if you produced a negative ad,
    
    74
    00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,760
    something that was against
    a specific candidate
    
    75
    00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,763
    or said something negative about them,
    
    76
    00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,620
    you would have to put your name on it.
    
    77
    00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,473
    You would say this ad
    was produced by whoever.
    
    78
    00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,533
    They wanted that transparency.
    
    79
    00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,503
    They wanted a limit on the
    amount of money that was spent,
    
    80
    00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,313
    the time in which those
    ads could be produced.
    
    81
    00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,670
    And if it's negative,
    
    82
    00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,160
    you actually have to
    put your name behind it,
    
    83
    00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,010
    so you can't hide behind a pseudonym.
    
    84
    00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,160
    One of the most critical
    Supreme court cases
    
    85
    00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,300
    that we're gonna look
    at in this entire course
    
    86
    00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,893
    deals with campaign finance.
    
    87
    00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,400
    It's specifically Citizens United
    
    88
    00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,120
    v. the Federal Election Commission.
    
    89
    00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,653
    And it happened in 2010.
    
    90
    00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,480
    Citizens United is a
    nonprofit conservative group
    
    91
    00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,030
    and they wanted to advance a documentary
    
    92
    00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,990
    that they thought depicted
    Hillary Clinton, accurately.
    
    93
    00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,890
    Other people would say depicted
    her negatively or falsely.
    
    94
    00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,970
    So they said we should be able to spend
    
    95
    00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,023
    as much money as we want
    pushing forth this documentary.
    
    96
    00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,340
    Federal Election Commission said
    
    97
    00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,503
    you can't do that by the BCRA.
    
    98
    00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,680
    Remember that McCain Feingold Act
    
    99
    00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,420
    that limited the amount of
    money when ads could be run,
    
    100
    00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,920
    and if you have to add
    your name to a negative ad.
    
    101
    00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,943
    This was challenged
    
    102
    00:04:12,943 --> 00:04:14,750
    and went all the way up
    to the Supreme court.
    
    103
    00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,750
    The main issue is, does the BCRA
    
    104
    00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,393
    violate the 1st Amendment
    right to free speech?
    
    105
    00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,450
    The Citizens United have the right
    
    106
    00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,380
    to put forth that documentary and fund it
    
    107
    00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,700
    and say whatever they want.
    
    108
    00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,223
    Is that their constitutionally
    protected right?
    
    109
    00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,033
    The Supreme court says, yes,
    
    110
    00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,870
    Citizens United, which is
    technically a corporation
    
    111
    00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,683
    has the right to free speech,
    
    112
    00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,253
    the same as an individual.
    
    113
    00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,610
    The Supreme court base this upon
    
    114
    00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,163
    there's prior restraint on
    political speech via the BCRA.
    
    115
    00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,260
    You may remember prior restraint
    
    116
    00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,120
    from when we talked about media
    
    117
    00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,990
    and what can be said
    and what cannot be said.
    
    118
    00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,970
    Is basically saying, if
    this is gonna harm somebody
    
    119
    00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,633
    you can't put out that story.
    
    120
    00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,560
    And the Supreme court is saying,
    
    121
    00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,680
    prior restraint cannot
    be used in this case.
    
    122
    00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,430
    Citizens United can say what they want.
    
    123
    00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,110
    If they want to fund that documentary,
    
    124
    00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,070
    that's their business.
    
    125
    00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,030
    And if it ends up hurting Hillary Clinton
    
    126
    00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,223
    that does not outweigh Citizens
    United right to free speech.
    
    127
    00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
    When would the ban have been acceptable?
    
    128
    00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,150
    If the corporate spending was
    likely to lead to corruption.
    
    129
    00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,670
    To prevent corruption,
    
    130
    00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,420
    the organization may not
    coordinate with the candidate.
    
    131
    00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,320
    So, if Citizens United was giving
    
    132
    00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:26,740
    $2 million in a duffle bag to candidate X,
    
    133
    00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,490
    then this may lead to candidate X
    
    134
    00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,970
    taking on policies that
    would benefit Citizens United
    
    135
    00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,373
    in a quid pro quo, essentially corruption.
    
    136
    00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,540
    Therefore the Supreme court
    would say, that's not allowed.
    
    137
    00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,960
    But because it's not a
    direct handing of money
    
    138
    00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,163
    from Citizens United to a
    candidate in that manner,
    
    139
    00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,393
    that this is allowed under free speech.
    
    140
    00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,060
    Citizens United has really changed the way
    
    141
    00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,463
    that campaign finance is done since 2010.
    
    142
    00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,060
    So let's recap what we talked about today.
    
    143
    00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,203
    In 1974, you have FECA.
    
    144
    00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,510
    This is the Federal Election
    Commission Campaign Act.
    
    145
    00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,650
    This put limits on the amount of money
    
    146
    00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,950
    that an individual can
    give to a candidate.
    
    147
    00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,830
    It also limited the total amount
    
    148
    00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,470
    that a candidate was allowed to spend,
    
    149
    00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,590
    and it required contributions
    to be disclosed.
    
    150
    00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,100
    It's very important transparency
    
    151
    00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,400
    who's giving money to who.
    
    152
    00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,330
    Luckily the Valeo struck down the limits
    
    153
    00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,130
    on campaign spending by a candidate.
    
    154
    00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,810
    We're saying that's an important part
    
    155
    00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,210
    of the election process
    the Supreme court ruled.
    
    156
    00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,413
    In 2002, we had the Bipartisan
    Campaign Reform Act,
    
    157
    00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,433
    also known as the McCain Feingold Act.
    
    158
    00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,253
    This banned soft money,
    
    159
    00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,690
    limited the use of
    corporate and union money,
    
    160
    00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,273
    and limited hard money.
    
    161
    00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,620
    We're really gonna
    focus on this corporate.
    
    162
    00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,633
    In 2010, the Supreme court
    said that wasn't allowed.
    
    163
    00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,700
    That BCRA ended up violating
    
    164
    00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,310
    the 1st Amendment right to free speech,
    
    165
    00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,653
    even by a corporation.
    
    166
    00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,563
    In this instance, Citizens United.
    
    167
    00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,590
    This has changed the amount of money
    
    168
    00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,800
    that's in federal elections,
    
    169
    00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,630
    as we're gonna see in future lessons.
    
    170
    00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,900
    And has a direct consequence
    
    171
    00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,450
    on how politics are conducted
    in the United States.

    'Types of PACs' : {id : "PxPLV95obQG5MlzISVjR4", transcript : `1
    00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,950
    - In previous lessons, we've
    looked at campaign finance.
    
    2
    00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,890
    How campaigns are very expensive
    
    3
    00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,760
    and they need to gather
    money from various areas
    
    4
    00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,610
    in order to actually fund themselves.
    
    5
    00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,400
    Today we're gonna look at PACs.
    
    6
    00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,463
    Also called political action committees.
    
    7
    00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,400
    These are when groups
    of people come together
    
    8
    00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,393
    in order spot certain
    candidates or legislation.
    
    9
    00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,120
    There's two different type of PACs
    
    10
    00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,670
    that I want you to be aware of.
    
    11
    00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,813
    Number one are called
    separate segregated fund.
    
    12
    00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,743
    Also SSF.
    
    13
    00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,640
    This is an account that
    is being used by a group
    
    14
    00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,713
    that is directly connected
    to a candidate or a campaign.
    
    15
    00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,690
    Therefore, this money is
    gonna be highly regulated.
    
    16
    00:00:38,517 --> 00:00:41,943
    On the other hand, we have
    a non-connected committee
    
    17
    00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,550
    As you can see from the title,
    
    18
    00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,660
    this is a committee that
    is not directly connected
    
    19
    00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,700
    to a candidate
    
    20
    00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,613
    and therefore it may
    raise unlimited funds.
    
    21
    00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,540
    It should be noted though,
    
    22
    00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,010
    these non-connected committees
    
    23
    00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,070
    and super PACS in general,
    
    24
    00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,650
    even if they're not directly
    connected to a candidate
    
    25
    00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,910
    are gonna look to what that
    candidate that they support
    
    26
    00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,453
    and like wants to be done,
    
    27
    00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,770
    even by signaling and
    then go in that path.
    
    28
    00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,443
    We're gonna look more to that now.
    
    29
    00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,570
    There's three different types of PACs
    
    30
    00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,520
    that we should really pay attention to.
    
    31
    00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,933
    Number one is called a super PAC.
    
    32
    00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,590
    They're much larger
    and they're not limited
    
    33
    00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,740
    in how much money they
    can raise and spend.
    
    34
    00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,723
    However, they must not directly
    coordinate with campaigns.
    
    35
    00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,483
    That's why I'm talking
    about that gray area.
    
    36
    00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,700
    They may not be in communication
    overtly with the campaign
    
    37
    00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,930
    but they're gonna listen to
    what the campaign is saying
    
    38
    00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,790
    and what they're pushing for
    and what that campaign may need
    
    39
    00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,940
    in order to become the
    one who wins the election.
    
    40
    00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,640
    And the super PAC is gonna
    try to help in that effort.
    
    41
    00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,173
    Number two is called a hybrid PAC.
    
    42
    00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,340
    They're hybrid because they
    have two separate bank accounts.
    
    43
    00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,340
    One that can coordinate
    directly with the candidate
    
    44
    00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,923
    and one that cannot,
    similar to the super PAC.
    
    45
    00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,293
    The last PAC we're gonna talk
    about is leadership PACs.
    
    46
    00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,870
    These are controlled by a candidate
    
    47
    00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,883
    or an individual currently in office.
    
    48
    00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,900
    They're gonna support other candidates
    
    49
    00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,863
    or other people running for reelection.
    
    50
    00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,710
    And the other people that are
    actually receiving the support
    
    51
    00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,853
    and the money aren't in control
    of these leadership PACs.
    
    52
    00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,520
    So let break it down further.
    
    53
    00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,093
    I may be a Senator.
    
    54
    00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,910
    I control this leadership PAC.
    
    55
    00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,920
    I see another Senator
    running for a reelection
    
    56
    00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,660
    and I like that Senator
    and I wanna help them.
    
    57
    00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,960
    I can divert that money
    from my leadership PAC
    
    58
    00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,333
    to that person's campaign.
    
    59
    00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,280
    The person that received the
    funds cannot control that.
    
    60
    00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,630
    What I do, what I don't do,
    
    61
    00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,770
    but if they receive it that's fine.
    
    62
    00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,070
    They can use that money
    to run for reelection.
    
    63
    00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,020
    So we've seen three
    different types of PACs
    
    64
    00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,810
    and how they differ in
    what they're allowed to do
    
    65
    00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,773
    and what not to do.
    
    66
    00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,910
    Let's look at how this money
    has grown over the past years.
    
    67
    00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,283
    Within PACs, there'll
    be two different types.
    
    68
    00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,090
    Dark money, refers to political
    spending contributions
    
    69
    00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,723
    that are not disclosed.
    
    70
    00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,530
    So it's happening in the dark.
    
    71
    00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,750
    It's not transparent about
    where this money is coming from,
    
    72
    00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,803
    who it's going to.
    
    73
    00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,903
    501s are nonprofit corporations.
    
    74
    00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,350
    So they're not being run to
    actually benefit the people
    
    75
    00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,570
    who run that corporation
    like a typical business
    
    76
    00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,313
    like Target or J.Crew would be.
    
    77
    00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,770
    They're doing it just
    to advance their causes
    
    78
    00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,030
    that they think are important.
    
    79
    00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,030
    I want you to take a look at this graph.
    
    80
    00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,000
    What do you see that happened
    after the 2010 decision
    
    81
    00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,220
    that the Supreme court had
    in terms of Citizens United.
    
    82
    00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,313
    In 2004,
    
    83
    00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,403
    there was only $5 million, about,
    
    84
    00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,943
    in dark money spending.
    
    85
    00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,203
    By 2008 there was almost
    70 million spending.
    
    86
    00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,843
    After citizens United,
    
    87
    00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,543
    there was $310 million
    in dark money spending.
    
    88
    00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,090
    Where it's not clear where
    that money's coming from
    
    89
    00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,890
    and who in particular it's going to.
    
    90
    00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,580
    That lack of transparency
    
    91
    00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,900
    is something that some people think
    
    92
    00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,993
    is a negative outta Citizens United.
    
    93
    00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,023
    But it makes it harder to
    see who's influencing who,
    
    94
    00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:52,053
    who's got control over somebody
    else via those donations.
    
    95
    00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,800
    So today we talked about
    political action committees.
    
    96
    00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,770
    What they are, the different types
    
    97
    00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,820
    and how their influence has
    grown since Citizens United.
    
    98
    00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,420
    It's important that you as
    an active member of democracy
    
    99
    00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,423
    understand this.
    
    100
    00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,560
    Number one, so you can
    contribute if you'd like,
    
    101
    00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,970
    but also so you can understand
    
    102
    00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,170
    where is the support for
    a politician coming from
    
    103
    00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,850
    and is that having an undue influence
    
    104
    00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,223
    on their eventual actions?

    00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
    - Welcome back to US
    Government and Politics.
    
    2
    00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,350
    In previous lessons, we've looked at PACs,
    
    3
    00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,523
    specifically political action committees.
    
    4
    00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,340
    These are groups of
    people that come together
    
    5
    00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,940
    in order to fund campaigns
    
    6
    00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,253
    to propagate issues that
    they think are important.
    
    7
    00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,270
    Today we're gonna look at interest groups.
    
    8
    00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,160
    They're a little bit different,
    
    9
    00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,565
    but they're also consequential.
    
    10
    00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:19,200
    (chill music)
    
    11
    00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,000
    Interest groups are technically
    organizations of people,
    
    12
    00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,750
    so groups of people that come together,
    
    13
    00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,273
    who share similar causes or concerns.
    
    14
    00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,080
    So they've got issues
    that they wanna advance.
    
    15
    00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,423
    These can be broad,
    
    16
    00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,053
    as in very wide,
    
    17
    00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,453
    or very narrow,
    
    18
    00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,410
    a specific thing that
    they think is important
    
    19
    00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,760
    and they wanna get it
    passed by the government.
    
    20
    00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,520
    They try to influence the government
    
    21
    00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,720
    in order to address
    those specific problems.
    
    22
    00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,343
    They influence via
    something called lobbying.
    
    23
    00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,210
    This is when they try to put
    pressure on the government,
    
    24
    00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,550
    that Senator or House of
    Representative member,
    
    25
    00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,020
    and it could be positive
    pressure or negative pressure,
    
    26
    00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,730
    such as we're gonna primary you.
    
    27
    00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:02,563
    If you don't do this
    
    28
    00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,800
    we're gonna have somebody else
    run and try to replace you.
    
    29
    00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,900
    Or if you do this, we can
    contribute to your campaign
    
    30
    00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,450
    and make sure that you remain popular
    
    31
    00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,673
    with your constituents.
    
    32
    00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,663
    Third, this is protected
    via the First Amendment,
    
    33
    00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,453
    specifically, the ability to assemble.
    
    34
    00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,380
    So the same way that you
    can come together in a march
    
    35
    00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,733
    you can come together
    in an interest group.
    
    36
    00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,490
    So let's talk about some of
    
    37
    00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,540
    these different types of interest groups.
    
    38
    00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,680
    It could be something from labor unions,
    
    39
    00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,890
    and these would address
    conditions of working people,
    
    40
    00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,123
    such as safety, hours, and compensation.
    
    41
    00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,583
    Some of the bigger ones are AFL-CIO.
    
    42
    00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,360
    They were separate labor unions,
    
    43
    00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,433
    but they actually merged in 1955.
    
    44
    00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,600
    We can also look at business organizations
    
    45
    00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,300
    and these interest
    groups are gonna promote
    
    46
    00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,123
    the collective interest of business,
    
    47
    00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,210
    and they're generally
    gonna oppose regulation
    
    48
    00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,593
    and legislation that
    promotes workers' rights,
    
    49
    00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,220
    'cause they really try to
    represent the business community.
    
    50
    00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,220
    This is such as the US
    Chamber of Congress,
    
    51
    00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,263
    which actually has 3 million members.
    
    52
    00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,333
    They promote a wide variety of issues.
    
    53
    00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,233
    Also the National
    Association of Manufacturers.
    
    54
    00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,270
    Then we can have
    professional organizations,
    
    55
    00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,560
    and they're gonna address anything
    
    56
    00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,100
    that that group of people wants,
    
    57
    00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,743
    such as the American Bar
    Association for lawyers,
    
    58
    00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,253
    or the American Medical
    Association, AMA, for doctors.
    
    59
    00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,453
    Then we have agricultural organizations.
    
    60
    00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,543
    These address farms and large
    scale agricultural issues,
    
    61
    00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,913
    such as the American
    Farm Bureau Federation.
    
    62
    00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,140
    Environmental groups,
    such as the Sierra Club,
    
    63
    00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,490
    Greenpeace, or Environmental Defense Fund
    
    64
    00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,900
    are gonna advance
    environmental protections
    
    65
    00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,700
    in order to protect the planet
    and fight climate change.
    
    66
    00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,170
    Then you've got single issue groups.
    
    67
    00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,710
    These are like single issue voters,
    
    68
    00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,350
    but they're groups of those voters.
    
    69
    00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,550
    They think that one specific concern
    
    70
    00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,420
    really overrides everything else.
    
    71
    00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,130
    You can look at this with NOW,
    
    72
    00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,283
    the National Association
    of Women, or the NAACP.
    
    73
    00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,173
    Finally we've got
    government interest groups.
    
    74
    00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,470
    These are groups of representatives
    
    75
    00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,090
    or state and local officials
    
    76
    00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,960
    who will come together in
    some type of an organization
    
    77
    00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,930
    in order to push forward policies
    
    78
    00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,980
    and issues that they think are important.
    
    79
    00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,223
    You can look at this with
    
    80
    00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:11,013
    the National Governor's Association.
    
    81
    00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,820
    So obviously there's
    many, many, many different
    
    82
    00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,653
    interest groups,
    
    83
    00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,260
    but not all are gonna be equal
    
    84
    00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,773
    in terms of their size or influence.
    
    85
    00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,130
    For example, some interest
    groups have access
    
    86
    00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,523
    to more money than others.
    
    87
    00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,520
    Via this money they can fund projects,
    
    88
    00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,743
    they can advertise,
    
    89
    00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,410
    and really try to influence legislation
    
    90
    00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,133
    in their favor in a greater way.
    
    91
    00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,840
    Some interest groups have
    more access to politicians
    
    92
    00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,293
    and other decision makers.
    
    93
    00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,170
    So when they pick up the phone,
    
    94
    00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,263
    that representative answers that call.
    
    95
    00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,180
    Some interest groups have even
    more dedicated participants
    
    96
    00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,380
    that they can rely upon.
    
    97
    00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,260
    These can be people that are actually
    
    98
    00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,940
    paid for their time and effort,
    
    99
    00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,390
    or people that are just
    so dedicated to the issue
    
    100
    00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,440
    that they really wanna be there
    whenever that's necessary.
    
    101
    00:03:56,385 --> 00:03:57,635
    I'll give you an example.
    
    102
    00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,883
    The NRA is the National Rifle Association.
    
    103
    00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,780
    They have a lot of money.
    
    104
    00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,260
    They have direct access to politicians
    
    105
    00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,080
    that really want their endorsement
    
    106
    00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,710
    when it's time for an election,
    
    107
    00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,660
    and they've got a lot of members
    
    108
    00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,770
    that believe fervently
    in the Second Amendment
    
    109
    00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,370
    and wanna do what the NRA says
    
    110
    00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,220
    in order to advance that legislation.
    
    111
    00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,470
    There's also something called movements.
    
    112
    00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,250
    They're not exactly issue groups
    
    113
    00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,080
    'cause they're not as organized
    
    114
    00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,230
    or as identifiable as
    a group like the NRA,
    
    115
    00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,870
    but you can take a look at the
    Black Lives Matter movement,
    
    116
    00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,220
    or the Me Too movement
    to see a bunch of people
    
    117
    00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,330
    coming together and fighting for a concern
    
    118
    00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,230
    and an issue that's important to them.
    
    119
    00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,560
    These movements can be
    very impactful as well,
    
    120
    00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,140
    as we saw in the summer of 2020
    
    121
    00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,860
    after to the murder of George Floyd.
    
    122
    00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,910
    So today we've looked at interest groups,
    
    123
    00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,070
    how they differ from
    political action committees,
    
    124
    00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,070
    but how they're also very consequential.
    
    125
    00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,830
    We looked at the different types
    
    126
    00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,870
    and how they can be
    different among themselves
    
    127
    00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,970
    in terms of the effect that they can have.
    
    128
    00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,820
    If you have an issue
    that's important to you
    
    129
    00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,650
    I would suggest that you
    find an interest group
    
    130
    00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,760
    and really see how you can be
    
    131
    00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,460
    an active member of our democracy.
