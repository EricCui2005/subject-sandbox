1
00:00:00,293 --> 00:00:02,876
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,690
- Welcome back to US
government and politics.

3
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,210
In previous lessons, we've
looked at the important role

4
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,110
that the executive branch plays
in the overall government.

5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,210
Today we're gonna see how someone goes

6
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,160
from being a normal citizen to
actually becoming president.

7
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,450
The first step in the process is someone

8
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,203
announcing their intention
to run for president.

9
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,130
This literally is the
first step in the process

10
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,740
and is all that needs to be done.

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,930
Often people stand in front
of some grand building,

12
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,713
or the house that they grew up in,

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,863
or they come down a golden escalator.

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,950
But what's really important is they said,

15
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,600
I'm throwing my hat into the ring,

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,023
I am gonna put forth
my name for president.

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,730
The next step in the process

18
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,080
is where elections actually
start getting held.

19
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,480
This is where the various parties,

20
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,980
remember the Republicans and the Democrats

21
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,910
are the two main ones,
are gonna figure out

22
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,560
who's gonna represent their party

23
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:05,973
in the race to be president.

24
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,963
Primaries, which happen in 80% of states,

25
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,300
can be closed, which means you have to be

26
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,123
an announced member of that
party in order to vote,

27
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,950
or they can be open, which
means anybody in the state,

28
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,500
whether you're Republican or Democrat,

29
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,743
can vote in that primary process.

30
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,493
20% of the states have
something called caucuses.

31
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,820
It's a little bit of a
different process where people

32
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,870
come together and they vote
by holding their hands up,

33
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,760
and verbal processes,
and things like that.

34
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,370
You don't need to know the ins and outs,

35
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,683
just know that it serves the main purpose,

36
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,500
which is that state's
party is gonna decide

37
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,563
who they think should be
the nominee from each party.

38
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,303
Next we go to nominating conventions.

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,590
This is where all the
votes from the primaries

40
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,770
and/or caucuses are tallied
up, and each party will say

41
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,330
this is the person that the
Democrat party puts forward

42
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,830
as their presidential nominee,

43
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,003
or the Republicans put forth
as their presidential nominee.

44
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,950
There's a lot of hoopla,
balloons, people glad handing,

45
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,930
and kissing babies, and
saying isn't this great,

46
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,980
we're gonna win, it's gonna be fantastic.

47
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,720
But a lot of it is getting set up

48
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,003
before the general election.

49
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,650
There's gonna be campaigning
before the general election.

50
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,543
Basically from as soon as
candidates officially announce,

51
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,300
they're gonna start campaigning,

52
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,570
which is they're gonna start
running advertisements,

53
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,453
getting out and seeing people.

54
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,900
If you've ever seen the weird scenes

55
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,710
when people go to Iowa and the state fair

56
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,060
and they all eat a hot dog,

57
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,363
that's because they're running for office.

58
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,690
They're hoping that people see them

59
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,560
and say that person is a good
leader, that person knows me,

60
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,570
and knows what I care
about, and therefore,

61
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,183
they would be a good person
to represent me as president.

62
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,140
The general election,
which is the first Tuesday

63
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,680
of November of every four
years, so it was in 2020,

64
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,743
now it's gonna be in 2024,
then 2028, and so on,

65
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,250
is where the president
is actually decided.

66
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,030
People go to the polls and they vote

67
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,980
for who they think should be president.

68
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,340
Then, each state will
put forward the votes

69
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,923
that they have via the electoral college,

70
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,410
and those are all counted up,
and the person with over 270

71
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,060
votes in the electoral
college becomes the president.

72
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,740
That one's a little bit tricky.

73
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,990
It's not just the person
with the most votes,

74
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,403
the popular vote winner,
that becomes president.

75
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,233
The electoral college is key.

76
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,940
Let's look at that via a map.

77
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,420
So if you've never heard
of the electoral college,

78
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,760
you'd say, shouldn't the
person who has one more vote

79
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,560
than the other person become president?

80
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,313
That's what a popular vote is,

81
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,840
and some nations do have that,

82
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,573
but the United States has
the electoral college.

83
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,010
And this was instituted as a
compromise in the Constitution,

84
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,530
remember that, very important
document we've talked about?

85
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,770
In order to make sure
that the biggest states

86
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,290
don't have all the power, that
some of the smaller states

87
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,493
also play a role in an election like this.

88
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,510
So, each state is gonna
have an apportioned amount

89
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,640
of electoral votes based
upon how many people

90
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,070
they have in the House of Representatives

91
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,670
and how many senators they have.

92
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,930
And remember, every
state has two senators,

93
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,160
but the number of people that they have

94
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,330
in the House of Representatives

95
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,330
depends on the population of that state.

96
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,690
So California's gonna
have 55 electoral votes

97
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,823
'cause they have 53 seats in the House.

98
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,270
Texas has 38 'cause they
have 36 seats in the House.

99
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,170
Remember, 38 minus their two senators.

100
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,470
Some of the other big population states

101
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,590
that we want to be aware of;

102
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:21,873
Florida with 29, New York with 29.

103
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,420
These are ones that are really gonna dwarf

104
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:28,700
the smaller states, such as
Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota,

105
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,330
they all have three, in terms

106
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,390
of their influence on
the electoral college.

107
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,853
However, some of them
are called swing states,

108
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,440
which is because they're
a little bit more purple.

109
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,853
So rather than consistently
red, like these states here,

110
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,130
they're typically gonna
vote for Republicans

111
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,830
and red is used as the color
to represent Republicans.

112
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,730
This is 2020, when the
incumbent President Trump

113
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,910
was running against former
Vice President Biden,

114
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,450
now President Biden, and blue states

115
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,673
are gonna be Democratic states.

116
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,663
Typically California is gonna go Democrat,

117
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,973
typically Washington and
Oregon, typically the Northeast.

118
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,673
Not always, but generally
those are gonna be blue states.

119
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,040
However, there are some swing states

120
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,003
that play a crucial role
in the electoral college.

121
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,623
They're Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania,

122
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,913
and then it was Ohio and Florida,

123
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,460
but they've gone a little
bit more red recently.

124
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,950
So, Republicans have been winning them

125
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,400
the past couple of elections.

126
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,363
What we wanna know is,
within these states,

127
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,860
the popular vote matters, obviously.

128
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,383
If you win Florida by one
vote, you win that state.

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,710
But then Florida submits their 29 votes

130
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,603
to the electoral college,

131
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,483
and those all get added up for each state.

132
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:51,623
The person that reaches
270 becomes the president.

133
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:56,330
In 2020, President Biden
got 306 electoral votes,

134
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,380
you could count up all these blue states.

135
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,990
And then President Trump got 232,

136
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,790
you can count up all the red states.

137
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,780
The last thing I wanna mention for this

138
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,660
is there's two states that
vote by congressional district.

139
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,010
So rather than just tallying
up the votes in their state

140
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,063
and saying our electoral
college goes to this candidate,

141
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,910
it could be different depending on

142
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,260
the district of the state,
so let's look at it.

143
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,803
Nebraska has five congressional districts.

144
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,310
They're gonna say four, at least in 2020,

145
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,800
of those congressional districts

146
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,200
think President Trump
should be president again.

147
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,093
One, Omaha, thinks that President
Biden should be president.

148
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,870
Therefore, Nebraska submits
four electoral votes

149
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,400
for President Trump and one
for Vice President Biden

150
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,800
at that time, now president.

151
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,430
Maine is gonna do something similar.

152
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,430
They have four congressional districts,

153
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,390
and in that case, three of those districts

154
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,753
went for Biden and one went for Trump.

155
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,060
So again, it's important
to know popular vote

156
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,743
for the states, then
become electoral college,

157
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,883
you need 270 to become president.

158
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,770
The last thing we're gonna
mention is the advantages

159
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,190
that an incumbent president has,

160
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,450
incumbent meaning that's
the president at the time.

161
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,700
So in 2020, it would've
been President Trump.

162
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,740
In 2024, if President
Biden decides to run again,

163
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,090
it will be President Biden.

164
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,250
Some of these advantages are,

165
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,720
they already have name recognition.

166
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,050
If you listen to the
news, you're gonna hear

167
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,240
President Biden, President
Biden, President Biden a lot

168
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,830
because the policies that he makes,

169
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,903
or executive actions or laws
that he signs into being,

170
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,453
or just whatever he's doing on that day,

171
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,940
the news is gonna report on.

172
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,540
So you hear that name a lot,

173
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,140
it's gonna resonate with people.

174
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,793
Number two, that's free publicity.

175
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,290
President Biden doesn't need to pay

176
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,643
those news companies to
actually say his name,

177
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,340
they're already doing so in the course

178
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,510
of reporting on what's
going on in the country.

179
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,660
So that free publicity
is gonna be helpful.

180
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,463
And number three, something
called franking privileges.

181
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,150
What this is is it allows lawmakers

182
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,803
to send materials to citizens.

183
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,410
The founders wanted this
so that the lawmakers

184
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,760
could directly communicate
with their citizens.

185
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,343
But as you send stuff to your citizens,

186
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,093
you can include things
that make you look good.

187
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,970
If you saw the stimulus
checks that went out,

188
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,130
they had President Trump's
signature on the bottom.

189
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,270
This associates the money

190
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,610
that went into people's
pockets with President Trump.

191
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,400
This is obviously beneficial to him,

192
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,740
and that's perfectly legal.

193
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,390
Because he's currently in
office, he can send things

194
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:20,313
to the citizens, key
thing, at taxpayer expense.

195
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,850
So he doesn't need to pay
for it outta his own pocket,

196
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,100
the taxpayers pay for it.

197
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,633
These three things represent
the incumbency advantages.

198
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,853
That's why, over the past 40 years or so,

199
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,720
there's only been two presidents,

200
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,613
the first President Bush
and President Trump,

201
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,133
that have not won reelection
and served two terms.

202
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,740
So today we've looked at the
steps for a person to announce

203
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,390
their intention to run and
actually become president.

204
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,963
We've looked at the electoral college,

205
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,673
specifically using 2020.

206
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,510
And we've looked at the
advantages of an incumbent.

207
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,950
Hopefully it gives you a better sense

208
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,600
of how a person becomes president

209
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,003
and what role you play
in that whole process.
