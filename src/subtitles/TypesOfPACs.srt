1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,950
- In previous lessons, we've
looked at campaign finance.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,890
How campaigns are very expensive

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,760
and they need to gather
money from various areas

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,610
in order to actually fund themselves.

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,400
Today we're gonna look at PACs.

6
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,463
Also called political action committees.

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,400
These are when groups
of people come together

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,393
in order spot certain
candidates or legislation.

9
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,120
There's two different type of PACs

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,670
that I want you to be aware of.

11
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,813
Number one are called
separate segregated fund.

12
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,743
Also SSF.

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,640
This is an account that
is being used by a group

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,713
that is directly connected
to a candidate or a campaign.

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,690
Therefore, this money is
gonna be highly regulated.

16
00:00:38,517 --> 00:00:41,943
On the other hand, we have
a non-connected committee

17
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,550
As you can see from the title,

18
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,660
this is a committee that
is not directly connected

19
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,700
to a candidate

20
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,613
and therefore it may
raise unlimited funds.

21
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,540
It should be noted though,

22
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,010
these non-connected committees

23
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,070
and super PACS in general,

24
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,650
even if they're not directly
connected to a candidate

25
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,910
are gonna look to what that
candidate that they support

26
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,453
and like wants to be done,

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,770
even by signaling and
then go in that path.

28
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,443
We're gonna look more to that now.

29
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,570
There's three different types of PACs

30
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,520
that we should really pay attention to.

31
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,933
Number one is called a super PAC.

32
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,590
They're much larger
and they're not limited

33
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,740
in how much money they
can raise and spend.

34
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,723
However, they must not directly
coordinate with campaigns.

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,483
That's why I'm talking
about that gray area.

36
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,700
They may not be in communication
overtly with the campaign

37
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,930
but they're gonna listen to
what the campaign is saying

38
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,790
and what they're pushing for
and what that campaign may need

39
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,940
in order to become the
one who wins the election.

40
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,640
And the super PAC is gonna
try to help in that effort.

41
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,173
Number two is called a hybrid PAC.

42
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,340
They're hybrid because they
have two separate bank accounts.

43
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,340
One that can coordinate
directly with the candidate

44
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,923
and one that cannot,
similar to the super PAC.

45
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,293
The last PAC we're gonna talk
about is leadership PACs.

46
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,870
These are controlled by a candidate

47
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,883
or an individual currently in office.

48
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,900
They're gonna support other candidates

49
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,863
or other people running for reelection.

50
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,710
And the other people that are
actually receiving the support

51
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,853
and the money aren't in control
of these leadership PACs.

52
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,520
So let break it down further.

53
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,093
I may be a Senator.

54
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,910
I control this leadership PAC.

55
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,920
I see another Senator
running for a reelection

56
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,660
and I like that Senator
and I wanna help them.

57
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,960
I can divert that money
from my leadership PAC

58
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,333
to that person's campaign.

59
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,280
The person that received the
funds cannot control that.

60
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,630
What I do, what I don't do,

61
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,770
but if they receive it that's fine.

62
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,070
They can use that money
to run for reelection.

63
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,020
So we've seen three
different types of PACs

64
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,810
and how they differ in
what they're allowed to do

65
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,773
and what not to do.

66
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,910
Let's look at how this money
has grown over the past years.

67
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,283
Within PACs, there'll
be two different types.

68
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,090
Dark money, refers to political
spending contributions

69
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,723
that are not disclosed.

70
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,530
So it's happening in the dark.

71
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,750
It's not transparent about
where this money is coming from,

72
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,803
who it's going to.

73
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,903
501s are nonprofit corporations.

74
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,350
So they're not being run to
actually benefit the people

75
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,570
who run that corporation
like a typical business

76
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,313
like Target or J.Crew would be.

77
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,770
They're doing it just
to advance their causes

78
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,030
that they think are important.

79
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,030
I want you to take a look at this graph.

80
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,000
What do you see that happened
after the 2010 decision

81
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,220
that the Supreme court had
in terms of Citizens United.

82
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,313
In 2004,

83
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,403
there was only $5 million, about,

84
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,943
in dark money spending.

85
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,203
By 2008 there was almost
70 million spending.

86
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,843
After citizens United,

87
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,543
there was $310 million
in dark money spending.

88
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,090
Where it's not clear where
that money's coming from

89
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,890
and who in particular it's going to.

90
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,580
That lack of transparency

91
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,900
is something that some people think

92
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,993
is a negative outta Citizens United.

93
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,023
But it makes it harder to
see who's influencing who,

94
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:52,053
who's got control over somebody
else via those donations.

95
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,800
So today we talked about
political action committees.

96
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,770
What they are, the different types

97
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,820
and how their influence has
grown since Citizens United.

98
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,420
It's important that you as
an active member of democracy

99
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,423
understand this.

100
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,560
Number one, so you can
contribute if you'd like,

101
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,970
but also so you can understand

102
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,170
where is the support for
a politician coming from

103
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,850
and is that having an undue influence

104
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,223
on their eventual actions?
